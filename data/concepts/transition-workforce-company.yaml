details:
  - title: Employment
    description: >
      Hires workers from declining fossil industries—oil rig crews, coal miners,
      pipeline welders, refinery operators. Provides W-2 employment, benefits,
      and job security.

  - title: Retraining
    description: >
      Builds training programs that translate existing skills to clean energy:
      welders become solar installers, rig operators become geothermal drillers,
      electrical workers move to grid buildout.

  - title: Deployment
    description: >
      Contracts with clean energy developers who need crews. Instead of hiring
      individuals, companies hire trained teams ready to work.

  - title: Continuous placement
    description: >
      As projects finish, workers rotate to the next project. The company manages
      the pipeline—workers never face unemployment between gigs.

barrierSolutions:
  - barrierId: regulatory
    explanation: >
      Workforce transition requirements are increasingly mandated for permits and
      social license. This company makes that compliance a profit center—you're
      investing in infrastructure that policy is pushing toward.
  - barrierId: complexity
    explanation: >
      Simple investment thesis: staffing companies make money deploying workers.
      The climate angle is embedded in the business model, not layered on top—
      evaluate it like any staffing company.

  - title: Data ingestion
    description: >
      Combines satellite imagery, weather history, climate models, soil data, water
      data, infrastructure maps, insurance claims, commodity prices, and scientific
      literature into one system.

  - title: Risk prediction
    description: >
      For any location and time horizon (1 year, 10 years, 50 years), outputs
      probabilities of drought, flood, fire, heat, storm, crop yield changes,
      water availability, infrastructure stress, and supply chain disruption.

  - title: Product delivery
    description: >
      Sells predictions to insurers (better pricing), investors (asset valuation),
      companies (supply chain planning), governments (infrastructure planning),
      and farmers (planting decisions).

  - title: Standardization
    description: >
      Creates "climate risk scores" that become industry-standard inputs—like credit
      scores, but for climate exposure. Every financial product eventually needs
      this number.

  - title: Builds livability forecasts
    description: >
      Uses phone-based surveys, satellite data, and climate models to score
      locations on a 10-30 year livability trajectory. Not just "will it flood"
      but "will there be jobs, water, functioning infrastructure." Granular to
      the neighborhood level.
  - title: Sells intelligence upstream
    description: >
      Licenses livability forecasts to insurers pricing long-term policies,
      banks underwriting mortgages, and institutional investors stress-testing
      real estate portfolios. They need to know which places are viable in
      2040—and they'll pay for that clarity.
  - title: Opens relocation accounts downstream
    description: >
      Offers individuals in high-risk zones a "Climate Relocation Savings
      Account." Users contribute monthly; climate adaptation facilities and
      philanthropies provide matching funds. When livability scores cross
      thresholds, funds unlock for moving costs, job transition, housing
      deposits.
  - title: Advises on managed retreat
    description: >
      Consults with municipalities facing inevitable abandonment of certain
      areas. Helps design voluntary buyout programs, relocation incentives, and
      transition timelines that don't wait for disaster to force the issue.

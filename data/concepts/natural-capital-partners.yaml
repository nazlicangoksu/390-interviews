  - title: Dependency mapping

      "Your cotton comes from regions facing 40% water stress increase by 2035."

  - title: Investment design
    description: >
      Creates custom portfolios of nature-based investments that reduce their
      specific risks: watershed restoration, soil health programs, pollinator
      habitat, coastal restoration where their facilities sit.

  - title: Return capture
    description: >
      Structures investments so the company gets supply chain stability (avoided
      disruption), first access to sustainable-certified products, carbon/biodiversity
      credits they can use or sell, and insurance premium reductions.

  - title: Aggregation
    description: >
      Pools corporate demand to fund larger projects. Ten food companies who all
      depend on the same watershed fund one big restoration project together.

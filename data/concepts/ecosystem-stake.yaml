details:
  - title: Acquisition
    description: >
      Identifies and acquires degraded ecosystems with high restoration potential—
      coastal wetlands, degraded forests, damaged coral reefs, depleted watersheds.

  - title: Restoration
    description: >
      Invests in active restoration: replanting, rewilding, water flow repair,
      invasive species removal, protection from extractive use.

  - title: Revenue generation
    description: >
      Monetizes the healthy ecosystem through multiple streams: carbon credits from
      sequestration, biodiversity credits from species recovery, water service
      payments from downstream users, sustainable harvest licenses, research access
      fees, and ecotourism.

  - title: Shareholder returns
    description: >
      Investors own equity. Dividends paid from revenue streams. Share value tied
      to ecosystem health metrics—verified by satellite, eDNA, and ground monitoring.

barrierSolutions:
  - barrierId: impact-measurement
    explanation: >
      Share value is directly tied to verified ecosystem health—satellite imagery,
      eDNA sampling, ground monitoring. Your impact isn't claimed, it's measured
      and priced into the security you hold.
  - barrierId: liquidity
    explanation: >
      Tradeable equity shares, not locked-up fund commitments. Buy and sell like
      any other security—you maintain liquidity while the ecosystem gets the
      long-term stewardship it needs.

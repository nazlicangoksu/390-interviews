details:
  - title: Permanent capital structure
    description: >
      Structured like Berkshire Hathaway, not like a PE fund. No redemption windows.
      No forced exits. Capital is committed indefinitely. Investors buy shares that
      they can sell to other investors, but the company never liquidates.

  - title: Century-scale assets
    description: >
      Acquires and holds assets that need generational stewardship—forests,
      watersheds, coastal ecosystems, long-duration infrastructure. European
      families own forests for 300 years. This is that, but accessible.

  - title: Dividend model
    description: >
      Returns come from sustainable yield, not exits. Carbon credits, timber
      harvests, water fees, ecosystem service payments.

  - title: Governance for permanence
    description: >
      Board structure designed for intergenerational continuity. Investor advisory
      councils. Scientific oversight. Constitutional commitments that can't be
      changed by majority vote.

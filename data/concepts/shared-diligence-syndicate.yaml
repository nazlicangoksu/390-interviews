      Risk assessments.

      Members who want to participate in a deal after reading shared DD can join
      the syndicate. Automatic pro-rata allocation. Coordinated term negotiation.

  - title: Collective leverage
    description: >
      When 15 family offices want the same terms, they negotiate together. Better
      pricing. Better governance rights. Better information rights. Deal quality
      improves because issuers want syndicate access.

    description: >
      The more DD in the system, the more valuable membership becomes. First mover
      advantage for early members who contribute most.

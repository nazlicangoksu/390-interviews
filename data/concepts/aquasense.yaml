tagline: >
  A hardware and data company that deploys soil sensors and AI-driven irrigation
  recommendations to smallholder farmers—but makes money not from farmers, but
  from the water utilities, agricultural lenders, and food companies who benefit
  when farmers use less water and default less often.

details:
  - title: Distributes sensors through existing networks
    description: >
      Partners with agricultural input suppliers, microfinance institutions, and
      farmer cooperatives to distribute low-cost soil moisture sensors. Farmers
      get sensors free or near-free. The sensor is the trojan horse; the data is
      the product.
  - title: Delivers recommendations via basic phones
    description: >
      Sends SMS-based irrigation recommendations calibrated to each farmer's
      specific soil, crop, and weather conditions. No smartphone required. No
      app to download. Tells farmers when to irrigate and how much—saving 20-40%
      of water while maintaining or improving yields.
  - title: Sells water savings upstream
    description: >
      Water utilities in stressed basins pay for verified agricultural water
      savings that reduce pressure on municipal supply. Payment per cubic meter
      saved, measured and audited through sensor network.
  - title: De-risks agricultural lending
    description: >
      Licenses predictive analytics to microfinance institutions and
      agricultural lenders. Farmers using the system have lower crop failure
      rates and better repayment. Lenders pay for risk scoring and early warning
      on portfolio stress.

  - barrierId: impact-measurement
    explanation: >
      Real-time sensor data measures cubic meters saved—continuously, verifiably.
      Impact isn't estimated or self-reported; it's hardware-measured in the field.
  - barrierId: risk-return
    explanation: >
      Revenue comes from creditworthy payers—utilities, lenders, food companies—
      not farmers. Multiple streams from institutional customers create predictable,
      de-risked returns.

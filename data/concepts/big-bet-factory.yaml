details:
  - title: Problem identification
    description: >
      Identifies climate challenges that require collective action (supply chain
      decarbonization, material transitions, infrastructure buildout). Problems
      where individual company action creates competitive disadvantage.

  - title: Coalition assembly
    description: >
      Recruits 5-15 competing companies who share the problem. Structures legal
      agreements that enable collaboration without antitrust issues. Beyond the
      Bag for plastics. Beyond the Packet for single-serve. Beyond the Grid for
      electrification.

  - title: Capital aggregation
    description: >
      Pools committed capital into joint ventures or shared investment vehicles.
      $50M from 10 companies creates a $500M deployment capacity that no single
      company would risk alone.

  - title: Execution management
    description: >
      Hires operators, manages investments, coordinates shared IP, and distributes
      benefits proportionally. Companies get outcomes without building internal
      capabilities.

barrierSolutions:
  - barrierId: market-size
    explanation: >
      This structure creates $500M+ deployment opportunities by pooling capital across
      10-15 major companies. You're not investing in niche climate—you're co-investing
      alongside Fortune 500 companies in infrastructure-scale projects.
  - barrierId: deal-flow
    explanation: >
      Pre-structured deals come to you through the coalition. These are opportunities
      built specifically for institutional-scale capital—no more sifting through
      early-stage pitches that don't match your check size.

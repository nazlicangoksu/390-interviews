details:
  - title: Performance guarantees
    description: >
      Wraps guarantees around nature-based projects. "This wetland will reduce
      flood damage by 40%. If it doesn't, we pay." Municipalities get natural
      infrastructure with the certainty of gray infrastructure.

  - title: Underwriting expertise
    description: >
      Builds actuarial and ecological models to price guarantees. Combines climate
      science, hydrology, and insurance math. Becomes the authority on "what will
      this ecosystem actually do?"

  - title: Project certification
    description: >
      Creates standards for nature-based infrastructure. Certified projects can
      get guarantees. This creates a pipeline of investable, de-risked projects
      for other investors.

  - title: The bet
    description: >
      Nature-based solutions actually outperform gray infrastructure most of the
      time. Guarantees rarely pay out. Make money on the spread while unlocking
      billions in nature-based investment.

    explanation: >
      Insurance-backed performance guarantees make nature as bankable as concrete.
      "40% flood reduction or we pay"—municipalities are signing these contracts
      because the risk profile matches traditional infrastructure.
  - barrierId: track-record
    explanation: >
      The guarantee IS the track record. When an actuarially-priced insurance
      product backs specific outcomes, you're relying on centuries of insurance
      math, not hoping a new asset class performs.

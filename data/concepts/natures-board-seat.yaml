tagline: >
  A legal and governance structure that gives ecosystems formal voting representation
  in corporate decisions—making "stakeholder capitalism" literal.

details:
  - title: Legal personhood
    description: >
      Works with companies to legally designate specific ecosystems as stakeholders
      with enforceable rights. The Amazon watershed becomes a named party in supply
      chain contracts. A coral reef gets standing in factory siting decisions.

  - title: Representation structure
    description: >
      Appoints human "trustees" (scientists, Indigenous leaders, conservation experts)
      who vote the ecosystem's interests. Not advisory, actual voting power on
      decisions affecting that ecosystem.

  - title: Trigger mechanisms
    description: >
      Defines which corporate decisions require ecosystem consultation: capital
      allocation above $X, facility siting, supply chain changes, water use,
      emissions targets.

  - title: Accountability teeth
    description: >
      Builds enforcement mechanisms—ecosystems can sue, block transactions, or
      trigger mandatory impact reviews. Fiduciary duty now includes duty to
      represented ecosystems.

    explanation: >
      Legal enforcement with teeth—ecosystems can sue and block transactions.
      Companies can't claim commitments they won't keep when the Amazon watershed
      has actual standing to hold them accountable.
  - barrierId: impact-measurement
    explanation: >
      Governance triggers create hard metrics: "ecosystem consultation required
      above $X." Impact isn't claimed in marketing—it's enforced through legal
      mechanisms with defined thresholds.

  A first-loss capital structure that de-risks private investment in Series B/C
  climate companies—the underfunded "messy middle" between seed-stage VCs and
  infrastructure-scale project finance.

details:
  - title: Catalytic capital absorbs first losses
    description: >
      A foundation, DFI, or philanthropic family office commits 20% of the fund
      as first-loss capital at near-zero return. If the fund underperforms, they
      absorb losses first. Your capital is protected until their cushion is exhausted.

  - title: Your capital gets de-risked exposure
    description: >
      You commit 80% at market-rate return targets. The first-loss layer means
      you can tolerate the longer timelines and lumpier exits typical of climate
      growth companies—without sacrificing your return threshold.

  - title: Upside recycles the catalytic layer
    description: >
      If the fund exceeds a 6% hurdle, catalytic capital recycles out and your
      share of upside increases. The philanthropic dollar gets redeployed; you
      capture more of the win.

  - title: Portfolio targets the funding gap
    description: >
      8-12 companies at $20-50M checks. Climate risk analytics, water security,
      grid resilience, resilient food systems—companies with real revenue but
      stuck between seed-stage VCs and infrastructure-scale project finance.

    explanation: >
      First-loss capital absorbs 20% of downside before you lose a dollar. Your
      capital targets market-rate returns with a built-in cushion—de-risked
      exposure to climate growth companies.
  - barrierId: deal-flow
    explanation: >
      Direct access to the "messy middle"—Series B/C companies with real revenue
      that most funds can't reach. 8-12 companies per fund, each at $20-50M checks.
  - barrierId: track-record
    explanation: >
      Blended capital structures have proven track records in development finance.
      The first-loss layer is designed for this—philanthropic capital that exists
      specifically to unlock private investment.

      investments. The bottleneck is often the CIO, not the family.

  - title: Immersion
    description: >
      Two-week program combining climate science education, site visits to climate
      investments (both successes and failures), and peer interaction with CIOs
      who've already integrated climate.

  - title: Toolkit delivery
    description: >
      Provides the actual tools a CIO needs to green-light climate investments:
      due diligence frameworks, risk models, benchmark comparisons, board
      presentation templates.

    description: >
      Alumni network. Ongoing deal flow. Direct line to climate investment experts.

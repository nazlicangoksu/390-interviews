details:
  - title: Outcome contracts
    description: >
      Signs agreements with buildings, campuses, and neighborhoods: "We guarantee
      indoor temperatures of 72°F for $X/month." Customers pay for comfort, not
      equipment.

  - title: Solution mix
    description: >
      Deploys the most efficient combination for each situation: district cooling
      systems (shared infrastructure), building retrofits (insulation, glazing,
      shading), smart controls and demand management, urban trees and shade
      structures, cool roofs and pavements, high-efficiency AC where needed.

  - title: Efficiency capture
    description: >
      Uses 40-60% less energy than conventional AC by optimizing the mix. Profit
      comes from the gap between what customers pay and what solutions cost to
      operate.

  - title: Grid services
    description: >
      Aggregates cooling load to provide grid flexibility—shifting demand, storing
      thermal energy, reducing peak strain. Additional revenue from utilities.

barrierSolutions:
  - barrierId: complexity
    explanation: >
      "Pay for 72°F, we figure out how." Outcome-based contracts mean you evaluate
      the company's ability to deliver, not the underlying technologies—simple
      thesis, straightforward diligence.
  - barrierId: risk-return
    explanation: >
      Utility-style recurring revenue with 40-60% efficiency gains over conventional
      cooling. Predictable contracts, clear margins, bankable returns—infrastructure
      investing you understand.

name: The Climate Option Fund
tagline: >
  A fund that invests in climate solutions we hope we'll never need—pricing the
  option value of having them ready if we do.

details:
  - title: Scenario mapping
    description: >
      Identifies climate solutions that aren't commercially viable under "best case"
      warming scenarios, but become critical under worse outcomes. Direct air capture
      at scale. Extreme heat infrastructure for 50°C days. Managed retreat planning.
      Food system redundancy for crop failure cascades.

  - title: Option pricing
    description: >
      Uses financial models (similar to pricing derivatives or cat bonds) to value
      the "optionality" of having solutions ready. Even if there's only a 15% chance
      we hit 3°C and need massive DAC deployment, the expected value of having it
      ready can justify billions in investment today.

  - title: Trigger-linked instruments
    description: >
      Creates financial products where returns are tied to climate thresholds being
      crossed—similar to how cat bonds pay out when a hurricane exceeds Category 4.
      Investors provide capital to develop solutions and get paid when specific
      warming levels, tipping points, or impact thresholds are reached.

  - title: Pre-need development
    description: >
      Funds R&D, pilots, and early commercialization for solutions that don't have
      current market demand but would face capacity constraints if needed suddenly.
      Builds the infrastructure now, so it's ready to scale if scenarios worsen.

barrierSolutions:
  - barrierId: risk-return
    explanation: >
      Uses the same derivatives math that prices catastrophe bonds and weather
      options. Expected value calculations justify the investment even at low
      probability—Wall Street has been doing this for decades.
  - barrierId: track-record
    explanation: >
      Trigger-linked returns remove manager risk entirely. You're not betting on
      a team's ability to pick winners—you're buying exposure to climate scenarios
      with contractually defined payouts.

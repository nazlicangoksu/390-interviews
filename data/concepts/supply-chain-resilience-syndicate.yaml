details:
  - title: Convenes competitors
    description: >
      Brings together 5-15 companies sharing supply chain exposure to the same
      ecosystems. All chocolate companies sourcing from West Africa. All apparel
      from water-stressed cotton regions.

  - title: Maps shared dependencies
    description: >
      Shows each company which ecosystems they depend on, and who shares that
      dependency. "You, Unilever, Nestlé, and Danone all source from watersheds
      60% degraded."

  - title: Structures collective investment
    description: >
      Creates joint ventures where competitors fund ecosystem restoration together.
      Cost-sharing proportional to supply chain exposure. Benefits shared
      proportionally. No free riders.

  - title: Deploys and measures
    description: >
      Executes restoration—reforestation, watershed protection, regenerative
      agriculture. Provides auditable metrics: "$X invested, Y% exposure reduced,
      Z disruption costs avoided."

barrierSolutions:
  - barrierId: complexity
    explanation: >
      Turnkey structure—the syndicate handles convening, legal structuring, and
      execution. You write one check and get exposure to professionally managed
      ecosystem restoration across multiple geographies.
  - barrierId: market-size
    explanation: >
      When Unilever, Nestlé, and Danone pool capital for shared watershed restoration,
      you're investing alongside $100B+ market cap companies in projects sized for
      real impact—not small pilot programs.

  - title: Policy intelligence
    description: >
      Tracks every relevant policy development—federal, state, international. Sends
      clients real-time alerts when something affects their business. "New EPA rule
      dropping in 60 days. Here's what it means for you."

  - title: Advocacy

      Builds coalitions across companies to push for supportive policy.

  - title: Revolving door

      where the bodies are buried. Clients get access to expertise that would take
      years to build internally.

    explanation: >
      Real-time policy intelligence from people who wrote the rules. Know what's
      coming 60 days before it drops and how to position for it—policy risk becomes
      manageable rather than unknowable.
  - barrierId: complexity
    explanation: >
      Hire the experts who navigate climate policy professionally. They translate
      regulatory complexity into actionable guidance—you don't need to become
      a policy expert yourself.

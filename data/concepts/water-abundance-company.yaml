details:
  - title: Rights acquisition
    description: >
      Buys water rights in stressed basins from willing sellers—retiring farmers,
      changing land uses, inefficient users.

  - title: Supply investment
    description: >
      Instead of extracting maximum value, invests in expanding supply: aquifer
      recharge projects, watershed restoration, water recycling infrastructure,
      agricultural efficiency programs, atmospheric water generation.

  - title: Security contracts
    description: >
      Sells "water security agreements" to customers: guaranteed access to X million
      gallons per year for 20-50 years at predictable prices. Customers pay for
      certainty, not just volume.

  - title: Value capture
    description: >
      Makes money on the spread between low-cost supply expansion and high-value
      security contracts. Asset value appreciates as water scarcity increases
      everywhere else.

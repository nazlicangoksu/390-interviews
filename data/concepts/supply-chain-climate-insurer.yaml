      Prices and sells insurance against climate-related supply chain disruptions.
      A chocolate company insures against cocoa drought. A fashion brand insures
      against cotton water stress. A seafood company insures against fishery collapse.

  - title: Risk-reduction investing
    description: >
      Instead of parking premiums in treasuries, invests directly in reducing the
      risks being insured: agroforestry for cocoa, water efficiency for cotton,
      sustainable fishery management for seafood.

  - title: Virtuous cycle
    description: >
      As investments reduce risk, payouts decrease. Lower payouts mean higher profits.
      Savings shared with policyholders as lower premiums—rewarding them for letting
      the insurer fix the problem.

  - title: Data advantage
    description: >
      Builds proprietary risk models from claims data + investment outcomes. Knows
      more about supply chain climate risk than anyone. Sells data/advisory services
      as additional revenue.

    explanation: >
      Insurance is a proven model with well-understood economics. Premium income
      plus investment returns minus payouts—you get returns from both underwriting
      and active risk reduction.
  - barrierId: impact-measurement
    explanation: >
      Claims data directly measures risk reduction. "Payouts decreased 30% in regions
      where we invested"—clear impact tied to financial outcomes, not estimated
      or self-reported.
